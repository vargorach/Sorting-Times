# The purpose of this code is for a user to find out the times of each
sorting method. The main input are the random values in each length of 
array going from 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, and 10,000 values in each.
The output is the time it took to complete the sort. To use this code the
user has no input and it runs automatically outputting the time values
in nanoseconds. The key variables are the randomly generated integers
named rand and the arrays containing them.
